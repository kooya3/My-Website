          <p className="pl-3 pb-2.5">I started learning to code about three years ago, and since then I've become proficient in a variety of programming languages including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Tailwind, Sass, Next.js, Python, Sveltekit, and Three.js.</p>
          <p className="pl-3 pb-2.5">I'm only 19 years old, but I'm constantly working to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies. Coding is my true passion, and I try to practice as often as I can.</p>
          <p className="pl-3 pb-2.5">I come from an impoverished family background, and I'm from a country where the IT sector can be difficult to break into. However, I've never let that hold me back. I've let my skills speak for themselves, and I'm always ready for a new challenge.</p>
          <p className="pl-3 pb-2.5">Whether I'm working on a personal project or collaborating with a team, I'm always excited to put my skills to the test and create something amazing. I hope to use my talents to make a positive impact on the world and help others achieve their goals. </p>
